# SQL Salaries Analysis with SQLite and EDA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **SQL-based data analysis** using a SQLite database, followed by **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** in Python.  
The goal is to reinforce the idea that **SQL is the primary language for data analysts**, while Python is used for deeper analysis and visualization.

The dataset contains salary information for employees from **2011 to 2014**, including base pay, overtime, benefits, job titles, and employment status.
